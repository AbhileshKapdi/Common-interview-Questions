# **Common interview question (for example 'content writer')**


<b>Tell me something about yourself/ Introduce yourself?</b>

<p>This is one of the most common interview questions raised. This must be answered carefully and honestly. This is generally asked to know about you but not about your details.

Many candidates hesitate while telling this answer rather than telling their details of work and professional life.

 Nothing to be afraid in this regard. You can always tell your answers by beginning with name, hometown and then qualifications especially your graduation and school life, hobbies and then move towards your work experience and professional life.

This is the way you should cover the answer. If an interviewer asks you some family details then you can answer otherwise it’s not mandatory.</p>



<b>What are your strong and weak points?</b>

<p>This question needs to be answered with proper attention as it’s quite a relevant question to convey a good impression from starting.

Strong points you can tell like discipline, punctuality, innovation and creativity, organic SEO writing, consistency, teamwork, coordination.

The weak points need to answer in such a manner that they seem like your strong ones or you can tell them there are a few areas in which you need improvement.

You can start this by quoting ‘ I have some areas of improvement like exploring new things and new writing formats is always my desire but couldn’t do successfully yet’. So, this answer must be handled carefully.</p>
